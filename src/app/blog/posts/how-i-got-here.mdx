## We were kids… once.

Do you remember your first memory as a child? It's hazy, but I remember mine. It was Easter Sunday at my parents new home. I was a boy of four, and I remember colors. The vibrant green of Florida in the spring, the feeling of grass on my feet while I rushed to collect eggs dyed red and blue, yellow and orange, scattered throughout the lawn. Parents and grandparents watching us race through the yard as only kids can. What would that child, hands stained every color in the rainbow from fresh dyed eggs, think of the person I am now? Turning a question to you, yes you reading this right now, what would that 'youngest version' of yourself from your earliest memory think of the adult they became?

I know mine would certainly be confused and disappointed; we failed to live out our childhood dream. We failed to become the Red Power Ranger from the 90’s classic: [1995 Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113820/characters/nm0290969/?ref_=tt_cst_c_4).

I would go on to fail at quite a few things in my life. Becoming a professional musician, my first year of College, thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail at 19, becoming a Park Ranger, then attempting to be a state Geologist. The accumulation of these failures has led me to a point many would call success, making a career transition as a full-time Software Engineer.

## My Music Arc

Music taught me a lot in my youth. Not just listening, but the act of performing it. I found community in a pilot program at my arts school: The Rock Band program. Students learned the art of playing music live. Guitarists and vocalists were paired with drummers and bassists. We rehearsed our set lists live every day, and held monthly concerts in the courtyard at lunch. At this age all I endeavored to be was a professional musician. My idols were rockstars. My walls and wardrobe were adorned with merch from the 2010-2014 Vans Warped Tour. Eventually I got to meet one of my idols, the lead singer of an often underrated band: Casey Anthony of The Dear Hunter. Outside a small dive-bar venue, Casey put me onto a podcast episode that would serve as a big underpinning for a lot of my life. The Upside of Quitting from Freakanomics: [https://freakonomics.com/podcast/the-upside-of-quitting-3/](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/the-upside-of-quitting-3/)

To give you a quick overview, the podcast covers a couple big things:

- Sometimes quitting is not a sign of failure
- The philosophy of ‘winners never quit’ leads to a sunk cost fallacy.
  - In my example: am I so invested in music at 16 that the best way forward is to invest in my strengths, and not re-skill into another walk of life?
- In life, sometimes the right move is to find a better path versus treading headlong into a brick wall.

My “brick walls” truly manifested when I started college.

## Quitting everything I had ever known

I was failing out by the end of my freshman year. It was devastating. Like many students, I never developed the routines and habits to effectively study. I couldn’t brute force my way through my coursework, refused to ask for help, and to top it off my band just broke up. You name it, and it wasn’t going well.

In the wake of failure, I got swept up by circumstance. Those winds of circumstance grew into a gust that, a few short weeks, deposited me at Katadhin Stream Campground the northern terminus of the fabled Appalachian Trail. I didn’t know understand the deeper reasons that motivated me to do this, but I knew I couldn’t keep living my life as I was. **I had to quit.** To try something new. For 4 months, through highs and lows that I couldn’t begin to fit in this article, **I put one foot in-front of the other.** Sometimes those feet carried me through steep mountains and treacherous terrain. The way forward sometimes **IS** a steep climb. Sometimes it **IS** daunting. Sometimes you **must** rest. Regardless, just keep moving forward. You’ll make it the other-side, it just might take some time.

When I came home, I found myself a stranger in my own life. The friends I had, the hobbies I kept, the way I lived, they all didn’t fit me anymore. The guitar was gently placed back in it’s case, the spiral notebooks softly shelved. All that was left was “_me”,_ a different person walking in the same ole shoes.

The next few years were spent with me finding a balance of two complimentary ideals:

- Knowing when to quit and pivot.
- Evaluating when it’s worth it to keep pushing.

## What came next:

In 2019 I settled on going back to school with the hope of becoming a state or federal Geologist. By the time 2020 rolled around; well you know where this is going. The day before my college shut down classes, my Geology professor told us we should look into studying Python courses amidst the chaos. That $13 Udemy Python course was better structured than any college course I had ever taken. It was at this moment, I saw a path forward. A ray of sunlight glimmering through the trees if you will.

Within the month I was googling careers involving programming. While that Udemy course still sits unfinished, as they all to often tend to do, I came across the foundation of my success in this field. A budding community called 100Devs, with the illustrious Leon Noel at the helm of the program.

## Finding Tech

Leon has made a difference in many lives, and certainly in mine. He crafted not only a virtual classroom for aspiring developers, but a robust community of folks who want you to succeed. After going through program, I found myself in the horrific job market of 2023. In a space where instant success wasn’t feasible, I reverted to what I knew. Small, incremental steps forward. I found freelancing opportunities for small businesses; slowly, but steadily, I landed bigger and bigger bits of work. From freelancing, to contracting, to eventual full-time work. I’ve gotten to work with names like Saran Yitbarek at her startup Disco, Shashi Lo at Gridiron survivor; and now I find myself as a community Ambassador for Torc, in conjunction with my full-time dev role.

The reality is I didn’t find success as quick as some others, my journey was uniquely my own. At my own pace, on my own time. While in retrospect the path seems clear, when I was feeling low; when I lacked the strength internally to keep moving forward I was able to lean into the communities I’ve built in this field; lean into 100devs, or Gridiron, or Torc. While I debated my purpose and ability to acclimate in this field, my friends never did. They created opportunities for me, erased the doubt that was percolating in my mind. This is not unlike my experience backpacking in the mountains. I knew I’d get there, it was never in doubt as long as I kept moving forward. It was almost inevitable. The only thing impeding my progress was myself; and at the times I was my biggest obstacle, I had my friends to light my way.

## Today

After the slow and gradual trudge through the muck, the inevitable happened. I broke through. Today I am a full-time Application Developer in the logistics space and an ambassador for Torc: a company working on streamlining the tech hiring process. I’ve found mentors, broken prod, overshot deadlines, and made lifelong friends; all by taking it one step at a time. I started this whole article by begging a question. Would that young kid running around on Easter Sunday be proud of me. I don’t think he would. What I can say is that the current me has done what the “me of yester-year” thought improbable, and the me circa five years ago would’ve thought impossible.

We are the people we want to be. Even if the dream

Thanks for reading the rantings and ravings of lil ole me. Means a lot.
