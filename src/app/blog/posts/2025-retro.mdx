![2025 Year in Review](/images/retro-cover.jpeg)

## Intro

It's been a swell year. By most metrics the most successful on record; yet I'm still left craving something more. I'm hoping somewhere along the way of writing this we'll figure out exactly what that something more is, how to get to it, and hopefully stop any further "something mores'" from popping up.

## Work

I landed my first fulltime software engineering role this year. I would say I've had a fairly large impact. I've experienced a large scale core SAAS update, upgrading core business software through 8 years worth of versions all at once. I authored a reusable auth integration leveraging Microsoft Authentication Library for React. Saved my company a bunch of money, wrote the style guide for updating Jira tickets yadadada. I'm basically saying, I did a bunch of techie stuff; and for the first time in my career in tech, have the distinct pleasure of observing my knowledge crystalize into competency. It's a feeling I know well from my past role in the forest service, and one that I was surprised to experience already here. This has been a long-winded way of saying a single thing: **work good.** Now what about not work?

## Not Work

Better than good. I think. I've found community in several techie havens. I've met a lot of wonderful folks that have handcuffed me, put me in a straight-jacket, and are dragging me, an unwilling participant, to do better. Despite all the kicking and screaming, I've done some stuff. Being on the [Free Code Camp podcast](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/from-drop-out-to-backpacker-to-self-taught-developer-with-dominick-monaco-podcast-183/) this year with the esteemed Quincy Larson is a notable one. I joined a book club full of brilliant people. They all have seemingly forgot the notion of reading for fun, and instead choose to read O'Reilly text books; the current one being [Designing Data Intensive Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/).

While the discussions and text are enlightening, clarifying, and sometimes downright dense as a bundt cake; I can't help but think I need to show these folks what real fun is. If fun for them is reading about the ins-and-outs of the historical differences between NoSQL and SQL databases. If earnest enjoyment is found in learning of the trade-offs in navigating regressions via application code or schema updates? I wonder what would happen if they experienced the divine rapture of eating a turkey leg and going to ride on a roller-coaster? I fear their minds would explode.

I digress. I'm grateful to these friends of mine to hoist me up by my collar and show me that life is about more than poorly implemented useEffects causing global service outages. It's about the friends you cause those outages with!

## What Are My Goals for This Year?

Pretty simple. Keep moving forward. I've come pretty far by just putting one foot in front of the other, so I think it wise to keep doing that. My current step is the Gridiron Survivor annual hackathon. Last year my wonderful team and I built a secret-santa application that recently launched as a full product. Here's to hoping this year's project, an AI powered travel agent application, is built with the same magic we harnessed from 12 months ago.

I want to get better at development. Not for money or career goals, but just to keep up with the friends that are going full-steam ahead towards excellence. I think keeping up with the people you love and respect is a good goal. Whether it's in Tech, on a hiking trail, or tackling the famous St. Paul Saints "Land of 10,000 Calories" challenge, in which an endless queue of 6ft hotdogs awaits each contestant.

Now I'm hungry. Thanks for reading, and happy new year!
