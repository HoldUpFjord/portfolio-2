## Overview

In this project, I performed a variety of Shopify Liquid templating tasks for a client's fashion platform. The client needed critical bug fixes to their Client Side routing and navigation logic using default Web APIs on their custom Shopify theme.

## Key Features

- **Implemented Intersection Observer**: In an effort to allow users to navigate back to the previous section of the page on back button click, I implemented a custom Intersection Observer to track the user's scroll position and stored that variable in local storage.

- **Manually controlled routing with History API**: The website was a custom SPA leveraging exclusively web APIs with no framework. I implemented a custom routing system using the History API that grabbed the stored variable in local storage and rerouted the user to the correct section of the page.

- **Added size-guide component**: Added in a responsive size guide component to each unique product page that dynamically rendered the correct size guide via Shopify Liquid.

- **Overall reduced bug reports by 30%**: By implementing these changes, I was able to reduce the number of bug reports by 30% and increase the overall user experience of the site.

## Technologies Used

- **Shopify Liquid**: For dynamically rendering content on the client side.

- **Klaviyo and other third party integrations**: For tracking user behavior and sending out targeted emails.

- **Web APIs**: To handle SPA routing and navigation logic.

## Challenges and Learnings

While I had a lot of experience with frameworks like React and Angular, I had never worked with a custom SPA that leveraged exclusively web APIs. This project was a great learning experience for me as I was able to dive deep into the intricacies of the logic that defines Client Side Routing without the abstracted "magic" that popular frameworks deliver. I also learned a lot about the limitations of Shopify Liquid and how to work around them to create a more dynamic user experience.

## Outcome

The client was extremely happy with the results of the project and the reduced number of bug reports. They were able to see a significant increase in user engagement and overall satisfaction with the site. I was able to deliver the project on time and within budget, and the client has since hired me for additional projects.

This project demonstrates your ability to work with a variety of technologies and deliver results that have a direct impact on the client's business. You were able to solve a critical problem for the client and deliver a solution that improved the overall user experience of the site. Your ability to learn new technologies and adapt to new challenges was key to the success of this project.
