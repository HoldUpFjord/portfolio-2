## Overview

A secret santa gift exchange platform that runs on Next.JS, Supabase, OpenAI, built on ShadCN.

## Key Features

- **User Prefernce Customization**: Each user can customize their preferences to ensure their Secret Santa has the best chance of finding the perfect gift.
- **Themed UX**: A holiday-themed user interface that creates a festive atmosphere for users.
- **AI Generated product links**: User preferences are fed into our AI model to generate products guarenteed to be a hit. Each suggestion has a built in amazon link for easy purchase.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For fast, server-rendered React applications.
- **Supabase**: For user authentication and data storage.
- **ShadCN**: For styling React components with a modular, themable approach.
- **OpenAI**: For serving as a robust backend API handling relevant user preferences.

## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was balancing the need for flexibility with the desire to maintain velocity. The solution was an AGILE based approach with sprint boards and weekly retros.Additionally, the complexity of sorting algoirthm implementation was an open debate. Initialy we wanted a more robust solution as outlined [here](https://binary-machinery.github.io/2021/02/03/secret-santa-graph.html). However, we decided to go with a simpler solution to ensure we could meet our deadline.

## Outcome

I actually finished a hackathon project, and we built a sleek and functional product with a roadmap for iteration.
