## Overview

GridIron Survivor is a NFL Survivor Pool product. Built on NextJS, Appwrite, and ShadCN, we're building the future of NFL Survivor Pools.

## Key Features

- **Expanded Test Coverage**: Expanded Unit Test coverage by 15% in Jest.

- **Built out the sidebar component**: Refactored the sidebar list items to be reusable componenets.

## Technologies Used

- **NextJS**: For dynamically rendering content on the client side and statically rendering on the server.

- **Appwrite**: A backend as a service platform that runs on PostgreSQL.

- **ShadCN**: Styling library that is built on Radix Primitives with TailwindCSS.

- **Jest and Playwright**: For unit and end-to-end testing respectively.

- **Typescript**: For type safety and better code quality.

## Challenges and Learnings

Gridiron Survivor is a distributed team running on AGILE and Scrum principles. Maintaining velocity while handling stringent code review processes has been the biggest hurdle. For the sidebar componenet in partcular the ticket, initially just adding in an additional list item, evolved in scope in an effort to preserve and maintin code quality

## Outcome

The client was extremely happy with the results of the project and the reduced number of bug reports. They were able to see a significant increase in user engagement and overall satisfaction with the site. I was able to deliver the project on time and within budget, and the client has since hired me for additional projects.

This project demonstrates your ability to work with a variety of technologies and deliver results that have a direct impact on the client's business. You were able to solve a critical problem for the client and deliver a solution that improved the overall user experience of the site. Your ability to learn new technologies and adapt to new challenges was key to the success of this project.
